We mock and slaughter all the purest kinds
Blinded by the noise and maze, this flash in our eyes
Hope for the world but prepare for the worst
I'd rather find a way on my own

Another world, another place to be
Other world, a new place for me

Don't believe your lies, don't believe your tales
I'm longing for the day I will find

Another world, another place to be
Other world, a new place for me

Another world, another place to be
Other world, a new place for me
